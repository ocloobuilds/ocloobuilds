Hi Everyone... 

My name is Dziedzom (mention it like jay-jom) Kofi Ocloo, you can skip to Anthony if you have a hard time mentioning local names from other countries. I hail from Ghana, a country in West Africa. 

At a time when I didn't even have a basic understanding of a computer motherboard (around 2006-7), a friend predicted I will one day study tech at some point and work on something. I paid little attention to his prediction, but here I am, I got into tech and find myself working on some few ideas. 

Currently, I am working on an open source project and some other ideas that require capitalist backing. I will give a brief about them. If you want to follow any of them, I welcome you, I am interested in the meeting of minds. I am interested in Web Development, System Development, Infrastructure Development, Managing and Writing. 

### Eweivwo 

I am Ghanaian Ewe. 

I was born in my hometown and bred in the city. As a result, the way I understand my culture has been vague and insufficient for a long time in my life. Over time, I came to realise a lot of Ewes of my generation or below face that knowledge gap if they (ever) come to that conciousness. I and a good friend decided to embark on a journey of making our culture and traditions easily accessible to a new generation of Ewes around the world. We are doing this through the open source way. I invite you to learn something new or pick on the challenge of contributing to the project. Please click on [www.eweviwo.org](http://www.eweviwo.org "www.eweviwo.org") (Not aunched yet)

### Parishner 

I am Catholic.

Catholic since birth, I have found out that the engagement the Church has with its followers is reducing in my country. I am not putting forward a theological debate but technically interested in bridging the gap. In an age of cool tech announcements all over the internet, my reason to work on church-tech may seem counter attractive to a lot out there, how much more being brave to ask venture capital for it. I am moving its pre-idea to the idea stage. [www.parishner.com](http://www.parishner.com "www.parishner.com") will launch in 2025.

### Passtens

I am not that into events. 

I have attended a handful of events in my life. I realise the experience for me can take a lot of effort about the human experience to get a ticket. You will need to interact with more than enough people to get a ticket. I am picking inspiration from LEGO and IKEA (no! don't own any of them now) to build a ticketing experience. I want to put the Do-It-Yourself (DIY) into ticketing. I hope it works out, [www.passtens.com](http://www.passtens.com "www.passtens.com") will launch in 2025.

### I Can Write Also

Out of the busy of technical stuff, I do indulge in other subjects as well. Yes, I have ever taken the time to write a better imagination of [James Cameron's Way of Water](https://ocloowrites.medium.com/rethinking-avatar-2-the-way-of-my-treatment-895a2ef259a6 "James Cameron's Way of Water"). I have some [content on Medium](https://medium.com/@ocloowrites "content on Medium"). I will be topping up with more soon. I am open to columnist opportunities for newspapers or a magazines.
